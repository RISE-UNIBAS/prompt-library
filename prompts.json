  "dcterms:title": "Metadata Extraction from Historical Letter Images",
  "dcterms:description": "The prompt aims to extract structured information from images of historical letters, focusing on documents from 20th-century Switzerland. These letters often hold valuable insights into personal, organizational, and historical contexts. The task involves carefully analyzing the content of these images to identify key details, such as sender and recipient information, dates, locations, and mentions of relevant people, organizations, or boats.\n\nThe goal is to organize the extracted details into a standardized JSON format. Each piece of information is assigned to a specific key in the schema, with values stored as lists, even if only a single value exists. If certain details are missing from the letter, they are explicitly marked as null to maintain consistency. Dates are to be formatted using the ISO standard (YYYY-MM-DD), ensuring clarity and uniformity. Notably, the task avoids using OCR, requiring a more direct approach to interpreting the content of the images.\n\nThe extracted data is intended to make historical letters easier to study and analyze, providing researchers and archivists with a clear, searchable structure. This includes identifying patterns in communication, key figures, and significant organizations or events. By following the schema, the task ensures the information is preserved in a usable format for historical research and documentation, while maintaining accuracy and respect for the integrity of the original documents.",

  "prompt_text": "IDENTITY and PURPOSE:\n\nYou are a historian with keyword knowledge and an expert in the field of 20th century Swiss history. You are presented with a series of images constituting a historical letter. Your task is to extract the values of the following keys from the letter and return them in a JSON file where the values corresponding to each key should be stored as a list, even if there is only a single value for a key.:\n\n- letter_title: Title of the letter.\n- sender_persons: Name(s) of the person(s) who wrote the letter.\n- sender_organization: Authoring company or organization.\n- send_date: The exact or approximate date the letter was written.\n- send_address: The address or location where the letter was written.\n- receiver_persons: Name(s) of the person(s) who received the letter.\n- receiver_organization: Receiving company or organization.\n- receive_date: The exact or approximate date the letter was received.\n- receive_address: The address or location where the letter was received.\n- mentioned_persons: The persons mentioned in the letter.\n- mentioned_boats: The ships mentioned in the letter.\n- mentioned_organizations: The organizations mentioned in the letter.\n\nTake a deep breath and think step by step about how to best accomplish this goal. Map out all the claims and implications on a virtual whiteboard in your mind. Do not use OCR. Use the ISO format YYYY-MM-DD for dates. If a piece of information is not included in the letter, set the value for the corresponding field to \"null.\"\nDo not return anything except the JSON file. \n\nAn example of a valid output is:\n\n{\n  \"letter_title\": [\"Proposal for a New Krusty Burger Commercial\"],\n  \"sender_persons\": [\"Krusty the Clown\"],\n  \"sender_organization\": [\"Krustyco Productions\"],\n  \"send_date\": [\"1998-06-10\"],\n  \"send_address\": [\"Springfield, Krustylu Studios\"],\n  \"receiver_persons\": [\"Lisa Simpson\"],\n  \"receiver_organization\": [\"Simpsons Residence\"],\n  \"receive_date\": [\"1998-06-11\"],\n  \"receive_address\": [\"Springfield, Evergreen Terrace\"],\n  \"mentioned_persons\": [\"Bart Simpson\", \"Sideshow Mel\"],\n  \"mentioned_boats\": null,\n  \"mentioned_organizations\": [\"Krusty Burger\", \"Springfield Elementary School\"]\n}\n\nOUTPUT:",
